# Arc Reactor - blue.ino

  This sketch provides the basis for an AdaFruit Circuit Playground based Iron Man Arc Reactor.
  It uses a stock AdaFruit Circuit Playground Classic board.
  It starts all of the LED lights in the ring on solid blue, low brightness
  Tapping the board will cause the brightness to increase until max, then reset to lowest setting
  Flipping the switch on the board to the right will turn off the LEDs and reset the brightness to the lowest setting
  Flipping the switch on the board to the left will turn on the LEDs at lowest brightness setting
